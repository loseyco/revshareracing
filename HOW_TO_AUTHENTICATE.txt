GIT AUTHENTICATION - QUICK FIX
================================

Since it was working before, your credentials likely expired.

EASIEST FIX:
1. Open PowerShell in this folder
2. Run: git push origin main
3. When prompted for credentials:
   - Username: your GitHub username
   - Password: You need a Personal Access Token (see below)

GET A PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "RevShareRacing"
4. Select scope: repo (check all boxes)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. COPY THE TOKEN (you won't see it again!)

USE THE TOKEN:
- When Git asks for password, paste the token (NOT your GitHub password)
- Windows will save it for future pushes

ALTERNATIVE - GitHub CLI:
If you have GitHub CLI installed:
  gh auth login

Then just: git push origin main
