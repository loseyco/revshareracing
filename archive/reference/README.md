# Reference Materials

**Reference to old versions for migration and learning**

---

## 📚 **Purpose**

This directory contains references to old code versions (`ircommander/`, `Archive/`) for:
- Understanding previous implementations
- Migration notes
- Learning from past decisions
- Avoiding past mistakes

---

## ⚠️ **Important**

**DO NOT copy code directly from old versions.**

Use old code as **reference only**. V4 is a clean rebuild with:
- Better architecture
- Cleaner code
- Professional organization
- Best practices

---

## 📁 **Structure**

```

## 🔍 **What to Reference**

### **Architecture Decisions:**
- Why certain approaches were taken
- What worked and what didn't
- Lessons learned

### **Feature Implementations:**
- How features were implemented before
- What can be improved
- What to avoid

### **Database Schema:**
- Previous table structures
- Migration paths
- Data relationships

## 📝 **Migration Notes**

When migrating features:
1. Understand the old implementation
2. Identify improvements
3. Implement cleanly in V4
4. Document decisions

---

**Remember:** V4 is a fresh start. Use old code as inspiration, not copy-paste source.
